💧 Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Analysis
Project Overview: Maji Ndogo is facing a critical water crisis. As a Data Analyst, I processed 60,000+ survey records to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and water quality issues. This project moves from raw data cleaning to a final, actionable engineering "Work Order."

🚀 Key Features
Data Integrity: Used SQL to reconcile field reports with laboratory lab results, correcting thousands of "False Clean" records.

Geospatial Insights: Identified high-priority towns where population wait times exceeded 2 hours.

Advanced SQL: Utilized CTEs, Views, and Window Functions to calculate population percentages and regional impact.

Prescriptive Analytics: Built an automated classification system (CASE statements) to assign technical solutions (UV Filters vs. Infrastructure repair) to specific locations.

📂 Project Structure
Database/: Contains the SQL dump file for the full Maji Ndogo dataset.

Scripts/: 5-part SQL workflow covering cleaning, EDA, and reporting.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: SQL (MySQL)

Concepts: Data Cleaning, Joins, CTEs, Aggregations, Views, DDL/DML.
